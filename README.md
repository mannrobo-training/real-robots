# Project 3: Real Robots
Part three of the course: learning how to program actual robots and work with competition modes/input.

### ** This project is intended to be more open-ended. There are some set things that everyone needs to learn, but you should feel free to explore your own ideas and ask questions. **

## Objectives
By the end of this project, you will have learned

* How to use a VEX competition template to structure your code
  * What functionality does the VEX Competition template add?
  * Where should I put my driver/autonomous code?
* How to create abstract control methods
  * How does abstracting control methods help me write better code?
* How to program driver controls
  * How can I use a loop to continuously update robot state?
  * How can I get input from the controller?
* How to write simple autonomous methods
  * How can I use sensors to alter program control flow?
